Before Christmas I sat the AWS Certified Developer - Associate (CDA) exam and passed! Here are a couple of my thoughts on the exam.

The exam was a good guage of whether you grasp the basic concepts of developing services in AWS, and I can say that it will really help if you have experience with the following services (in no particular order):

- S3 (of course)
- Lambda
- EC2
- SQS
- CLI, SDKs and APIs
- IAM
- Elastic Beanstalk
- DynamoDB
- ECS
- SNS
- CodeCommit,Build,Deploy,Pipeline
- KMS

Security in general was a big area of focus. This includes things like IAM roles, S3 Bucket Polices and ACLs, KMS (and KMS with S3). I found myself answering more of these questions rather than looking at any examples of code.

There were of course the standard throughput/limits questions to test that you understand the basic limits of AWS services, so I would make sure you familiarise yourself with these. For example calculating how many RCUs are required for a given application.

Overall I finished the exam with 884 out of a possibe 1000, and that was with about a week of fairly solid studying. As I mentioned before it really helps if you have worked with these solutions before as it helps ingrain the concepts in your head. I found that the material on the Linux Academy course for the exam was sufficient, and the practice exam was a good primer. I didn't have to use any A Cloud Guru materials but I have also heard good things about them!

I hope some of this helps give an idea of what to expect from the exam. As always you are best checking the exam [blueprint](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) for a comprehensive list of topics and subjects that you should understand before going in!

Happy new everyone, let's smash it!
