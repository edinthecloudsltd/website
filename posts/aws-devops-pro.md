After a long time of putting this one off, and a lot of on/off study.. I decided on Monday to schedule my exam for the coming Thursday. This gave me the kick up the arse I so desperately needed.

I passed the exam with a score of 950/1000, which I have to admit I was quite surprised at, as there were certainly some questions in there that I was on the fence about/unsure of.

### How was it?
Overall I found the exam reasonably challenging. Thankfully I work with a lot of the services in my day to day role, so lots of the services I was familiar with.

There were questions regarding Eventbridge (CW events), AWS Config, High-Availability & Disaster Recovery strategies, RDS (Aurora/Non-Aurora), EC2, Networking,ElasticBeanstalk, GuardDuty, Inspector, Trusted Advisor, AWS Health.

There were also lots of questions around the Code* suite, along with general CI/CD best practices that should be followed.

### Preparation
Without a doubt the best kind of prep you can do for these kinds of questions is to get stuck in and build/deploy using them, like I said I do this in my day to day, so I'm lucky in that respect.

For practice, I used the [tutorials dojo DevOps professional practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-practice-exams-amazon/) on Udemy. My first attempts a couple of weeks ago I was getting anything between 60% and 70% on them. In the days leading up to the exam I sat both practice again and got 80% and 81% respectively. I would say that these practice exams are probably more challenging than the exam itself.

A couple of hours prior to sitting it, I quickly checked out some of the [cheat sheets](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/) on areas I donâ€™t touch on often, such as Costs & Billing and services like Trusted Advisor/AWS Health.

### Tips for the exam
I can't really give any tips other than READ THE QUESTION THOROUGHLY. The questions will ask you to give (for example) the "most cost-effective" or "least administrative overhead" answer. Make sure you know which option meets these requirements.

You can also quite easily narrow down to at least two answers because two of them are usually complete bullsh*t. Just make sure that you understand what each service does at a high level so that you can quickly eliminate some choices.

If you are here whilst preparing for the exam, I wish you the best of luck with it, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardsmith92/) if you have any questions on the above!
